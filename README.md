# Research for Deep Deconstructed Learning Masters Thesis

This repository contains code using for implementing experiments required for my final Masters project on multi agent reinforcement learning. The goal of the project was to investigate ways a multi agents setup could be constructed where by agents would naturally specialise and work together towards a common goal.

The final report PDF is also located in this repository.
